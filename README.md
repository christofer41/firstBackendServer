# firstBackendServer


My first Back-end Server.

Install everything with "npm install"

This "program" contains a list of different greeneries and placing them in either "vegetables" or "fruits".
You might be surprised to find out how many different fruits and vegetables that are actually of the opposite class.

You can also add your own greeneries and assign them a class.

or, if you'd rather change something, you can go ahead and do just that.. no one is looking.

All this data is stored in the server that I built.
It can handle errors such as non-existing products, and trying to add something that doesn't exist.
You can however add things with special symbols and such so that you can use any kind of language or writing.

I hope that you enjoy this little test, and please do give me feedback!

Thank you!
